# Welcome!

My name is John and I am a third-year medical student passionate about cancer
biochemistry and computer science.

My goal in creating this site is to establish a repository to document and
organize my extracurricular exploration of the field of Bayesian statistics.
Please feel free to explore and see what you find.

This website was rendered from markdown using
[jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and is hosted as [a
public repository on github](https://github.com/johnmoise/extracurricular).
