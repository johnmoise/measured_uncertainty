# Analytic Bayesian Methods

In some instances, the use of specific combinations of likelihoods and priors
can result in closed-form analytical solutions for the posterior distribution,
circumventing the need for numerical integration. In these scenarios, when a
prior and posterior are of the same probability distribution, the prior and
posterior are called conjugate distributions and the prior is called the
[conjugate prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior) for the
likelihood.

The following pages will delve further into these conjugate priors and show
through worked examples how to apply them in appropriate scenarios.
